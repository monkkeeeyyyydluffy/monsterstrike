        Unit Evaluation - TLDR is both part1 and part2 have good units. Pulls on
        either banner would be good, but not absolutely required. Amuro has an
        insane SS. Conan (water) has OP kit, but lacks modern nulls. Also note
        the poll on GW has skip the gacha at 64% votes which is rather high, but
        wait for youtubers to release their videos.<br />

        Conan and Kaito Kid (dark 6* unit) does not have notable stages, but has
        slowdown panel, so likely has future usage.<br />
        Heiji (wood 6* unit) is strong pick for reizetsu detical. Not game
        breaking, not required if you are okay with other picks (nightmare,
        adamas, cc, etc...).<br />
        Shinichi and Ran (fire 6* unit) not a top pick for g4/c8; it may become
        top pick for future wood reizetsu.<br />

        Conan (water 6* unit) has very broken kit, but lacks modern nulls. Will
        likely not see future use. has become top pick for fire deep abyss.<br />
        Amuro (light 6* unit) has SS can potentially hit 50% HP, this is insane.
        It is strong pick for g7 on its own, but does not fully synergize with
        fairy team. Every unit is needed in fairy team because they fully
        synergize (klimt, uriel, gekirin). <br />
        Akai (dark 6* unit) is the skipable mon.<br />

      <p class="mb-2">
        For new players/beginner, look at the GW re-roll ranking page<br />
        Conan is rated C for beginners, so they are more suited for high
        difficulty usage, rather than general usage.
