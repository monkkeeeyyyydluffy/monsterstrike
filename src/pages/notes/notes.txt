* EX Cortina, Clear g10 for chance of invade
** Clearing g1-g10 without losing once increases probability.
*** "0 death 2%, 1-3 death 1.5%; if you die 4 times in g1-g10 its 0.5%."  (source: discord chat, no official source.)

* One punch strategies on the temple stages
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/6704

* See #ms-guide in the discord, click into the Google doc.
** has many sections, including "Temple of Heroes" section
** HIGHLY recommended you go to #ms-guide and review details there.  It is comprehensive guide.

* https://monster-strike-enjp.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Heroes
* https://monster-strike-enjp.fandom.com/wiki/Ableberries

* Will be brief, theres a lot of resources covering ableberries already

* Ableberries can be equipped to your mon
* Effects include, but not limited to: increase bump combo dmg, shave enemy HP, increase stats, and more...
* Eng resources may call the ableberry grades: S, S+, S++, XL
* JP calls ableberry grades: S, M, L, EL

* Use the ableberry board to farm efficiently.

* Farm efficiently: one shot team comps, bell for berry rate up, during monday, etc..

* Most people will farm Dark TT2, Light TT1, or Fire TT1 because of the popuar one shot team comps (as of 2025).

* Please understand how berries stack and apply to the team.
** IE. A Class Attack L (+3000) berry on a Bird class mon, will ONLY AFFECT BIRD class units on the team.
** Most berries of identical name do not stack, IE you cannot equip multiple genius berries (+65% exp), they do not stack. It only takes highest EXP berry
** But.. IE. A Class Attack L (+3000) berry on a Bird class mon and Class Attack L on demihuman class mon are considered different.  First berry provides +3000 to any Bird class,  latter provides +3000 to any demihuman class.
** Do not use knockout (KO) berries.  Only for a select few veterans and if you really understand the negatives of KO.

* For a serious player, common to equip attack berries like this. in sets of three.
** First unit has 3 L berries for Class attack:  +3000atk, +2000atk+2000hp, +2000atk+26.6spd
*** When you add up the three class atks total above, its 7000.
** Second unit has 3 L berries for sling style: +1500atk, +1000atk+1000hp, +1000atk+13.2spd
*** When you add up the three sling atks total above, its 3500
** Similarly, third unit has 3 L berries for bias. its the same numbers as sling: +1500atk, +1000atk+1000hp, +1000atk+13.2spd
** If these three units share same class,sling,bias; then in total there is +14,000atk
** You need to consider your entire TEAMS class,sling,bias when building the perfect set of atk berries for the team.

* In 2025 they released another temple, "Primordial Temple", for farming EL berries
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/522881
* GW states tested drop rate is 0.38%



!Berry Cage
===========

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/507621

* A feature to put ableberries into a cage as storage
** one berry per cage
** can store berries from temple result screen

* It costs 1 berry wand to transfer berry OUT of cage onto a unit.

** use 1000 gouzetsu points
** full clear Tenma Gardens

* Related terms or synonyms you may see

** can use this to overwrite berries you do not want

!Striker Records
================

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/465417
* Mission event - A collection of missions that provide rewards
* Currently on third event;   October 2, 2025 to April 1, 2026
* First event released in 2024

* The missions are related to various parts of the game, such as but not limited to:
** Farming luck (max lucks)
** Farming specific units (IE. during 2025 mission event, it will ask you to farm some units released in 2025)
** Playing certain difficulty levels (lethal, gouzetsu, reizetsu, etc....)
*** Can farming luck, max luck certain unit, or just clearing quest.
** Playing/completing certain events (Sand dunes, Tower, Abyss, etc.....)
** Farming berries
** Farming guardian beast forest
** and more....


* Scotts Youtube here can explain the system in general
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt-dzk8-Aa0
* 16:30 minutes mark.
* WARNING- they keep changing the UI every few months... but the overall missions are very similar and have not changed.
* 5 categories, 30 missions each.
* As you clear more missions, you rank up from 1 up to 10 in EACH category.


* Rewards
* Rewards based on maximum rank from any category
* Rewards based on average rank from all categories


* 5 categories
** max lucks
** mastery (uncharted desert, tower, abyss)
** zetsu (tournament, chouzetsu+bakuzetsu, gouzetsu)
** high difficulty (tenma, abyss depths, star grave, reizetsu)
** characters (evolving, temple, guardian beasts)

* points required for each rank
** 2 - 20
** 3 - 50
** 4 - 80
** 5 - 110
** 6 - 140
** 7 - 180
** 8 - 220
** 9 - 260
** 10 - 300



* Personal tips
** If you want to do complete missions, GW voters usually recommend reaching rank 10 in "max luck" category as it is easiest difficulty wise.
** Doing above gets you max rank 10
** Then raise rank in various other categories until you reach average rank 6
** It is very difficult to start event late, and "catch up", due to nature of some missions.


!Treasure 9
===========

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/246648


* A limited time mission related to clearnig the latest bakuzetsu quest.
** Shooting is latest treasure 9 running from December 26, 2025 to February 24, 2026

* There are 9 rewards: misc in game items.

* Clear the quest, then after result screen, you can shoot 1 of the random targets.
* It starts with 9 targets, and targets reduce by 1 each time you shoot.
* One of the targets will instantly clear all targets and you receive all rewards.


!Gacharido Lab
==============

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/491334

* Gacharido Lab is the free monthly pull that you will see on left side of home screen.
** It replaced the former mondama flipping cards, and before that the mondama system.



* TLDR: idle game, click to collect energy, spend 300 energy to summon
unit, get 1 free unit per month.

* Similar to idle clicker, go into lab and it auto-collects energy.
* Energy generates over time and maxes out at 30/30 roughly every
9hours.
* Gouzetsu points to raise cap to 40/40 (update v29.6).
* On MSday you can collect 50 energy for each element.
* Spend 300 energy of an element to summon a unit.
* Can summon up to 10 units, pick 1 unit for free pull (12 summons if
monpass).
* Has a mechanic that once you collect X amount of total cumulative
energy, you generate more (rare) energy.
** This first starts after you collect 500 cumulative energy, and again at
1000, and again at 2000.

* My Personal Tip - if your cap is 40/40, then collect twice a day, morning and night,
for max efficiency. if cap 30/30 then collect 3 times a day, morning,
midday and night.

* Theres two tabs

!Medal Shop
===========

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/36024

* Medal and magic stones are currency you can use to purchase helper items before a quest starts
* Can also purchase a unit, but units usually weak.

* Helper items purchased via medals include:
** Chest item adds two treasure chests drops to result screen
** Max HP item +10,000 to maximum HP
** Gauge item for always gauge successful
** HP Cut item for 10% HP cut on all enemies at start of each battle map

** There are many special item effects


!MonSpot
========

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/110850

* MonSpot is a feature to equip powers to provide in game buffs

!MonstDay (MS Day)
=================


* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/148272

* Campaign that runs every 10th, 20th, and 30th, at 12am japan time.

** Discord invite link: https://discord.gg/QWvbWAj


* Personal Tip
** farming with team of 4 gacha units can significantly speed up max luck farming.
** Online co-op will be active during MS day, take advantange of it
** Lucky mon of the week is useful to farm
** Can also farm harder quests on monst day.


!Gouzetsu Points
================

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/111439

* Gouzetsu points can be used to provide very useful in game benefits
** Earn gouzetsu points by clearing gouzetsu difficulty quests
** Can level up each benefit to level 10 using gouzetsu points

* In game benefits include, but not limited to:
** Receive 5 orbs periodically (every 7-14 days)
** Receive 3000 soul points periodically (every 7-14 days)
** Discount medal/luck shop (up to 30%)
** Receive items periodically (theres 3 different item sets, so 3 different bonuses)
** Raise energy cap on Gacharido lab from 30 to 40.
** Unlock additional berry cage slot
** Stat limit increase on gouzetsu mons (IMO not useful)
** Monspot antenna range increase (Japan Only; IMO not useful)

* Can earn up to 990 points per quest

* Related terms or synonyms you may see
** discord, auto translate via browser/youtube, etc..
* aka gouzetsu bonus
* aka gougen bonus
* aka gougen points


* My personal tip
** gouzetsu points are extremely useful, make this a priority for new accounts
** first level up these skills to level 1: orb, soul points, the three item generations.
** It is best value to level each to 1, to start receiving rewards.
** My priority for level 10 would be:
*** Orb, gachrido lab or medal shop, then its debatable for item generation/soul point/berry cage
** I would skip stat limit increase and monspot antenna range increase.
* there are more gouzetsu points available than places to spend... I may have 30,000 points left unused.


!Monpass
========

!Soul Badge
===========

* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/71333
* https://monster-strike-enjp.fandom.com/wiki/Soul_Badges
* Eng wiki is very informative, only missing a few of the newer soul badge powers.

* Soul badges is a system to (greatly!) enhance your units power
** unlocking soul skills (abilities) for purchase is tied to luck per element (so farm a lot of max lucks)
** purchasing soul skills and equipping them is by spending "soul spirits"
** up to three badge slots per element, equipping a badge to a unit requires spending "soul spirits"


* Please see GW for a complete list of soul skill effects (eng wiki has the older ones)
* Some of the most powerful and commonly seen soul skill effects are:
** VS. "element" (IE. VS. Dark) - up to +25% damage on enemies of that element
** VS. weak point - up to +10% damage on weak points
** VS. Boss - up to 10% damage against bosses
** VS. Mobs - up to 10% damage against mobs and mid bosses (non-boss)

* Also some very difficult quests gimmicks can be completely countered via soul badges
** IE. a quest with needle panels can be countered by equipping the 99% needle panel damage reduction
** There are soul skills to counter many gimmicks, such as SS delay, bump combo lock, ability lock, contagious fog, fire pillars, and many more.


* Common question - What is the gold border around unit portrait I see in multiplayer?
** Gold border around unit portrait means it is equipped with soul badges



!Units
======

* General information on each unit

* Please read "Monster Strike Introductory Guide" from  #ms-guide on discord
** Google document; Section 3 is all about units and extremely detailed. Section 2 is about evolution trees
** discord invite link: https://discord.gg/QWvbWAj
** discord #ms-guide link: https://discord.com/channels/267853822003642369/778379677660217365



* Bounce/Pierce sling type - unit will bounce off enemies or pierce through enemies.
* Class - unit will have a class, this affects your Class ableberries and also if enemies have slayer abilities.
* Bias type - Bias type can be Balanced or Power or Speed or Blast. This affects Bias type berries and has many other effects. See the "Bias Types" section

* Strike shot (SS) - special attack that can be used when fully charged
** to charge, waiting turns or using SS rotation related abilities
** For SS with stage 1 and stage 2 (aka gear1 and gear2), using stage2 will be stronger
*** IE. a 16+8 SS will have stage1 ready after 16 turns, then stage2 ready after an additional 8 turns.

* Bump combos (friendship combo) - hitting allies will trigger their bump combo, can also be triggered indirectly via blast-type bump combos
* Ableberry (Wakuwaku) - can equip up to 4 ableberries
** 3 slots are more common, 4 slots is constrained by a very rare item (As of Dec 2025)
* Luck Skill - A unit can have one of four luck skills, critical/shield/bump combo crit/guide. Activates by chance and chance increases based on luck of unit, luck spot (monspot), and soul badge skill.
* Luck - increases rewards at the end of the mission and also effects activation rate of your Luck Skill


* Evolution trees
** Base form 5*
** Evolution or Ascension
** Transcension
** Trancension Kai
** True Transcension (Shin Div)


* Kai (Trancension Kai) monsters have connect skills
** Connect skills must be activated by passing the activation condition
** Common question - what is the gold chain or silver chain on unit portrait?
*** When Kai unit has connect skill activated, it will show a gold or silver chain.
*** If connect skill is inactivate, it is greyed out.
** https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/171373

* Shin or True Transcension monsters have shot skills and assist skills
** Shot skill activated when you shoot, but does NOT activate during SS
** Assist skill only affects non-Shin monsters
** Personal note - shot and assist skills vary greatly in their effects. If you are an older returning player, S-skill/A-skill can have big impact on team building.

* aka lucky monster of the week

!Gimmicks, Hazards and misc.
============================


* Gimmicks and hazards on quests
** At low difficulty, ignoring gimmicks are a mere nuisance and will not stop you from clearing quest
** Higher the difficulty, gimmicks may deal fatal instant death damage, or prevent you from dealing any damage. Must counter gimmicks with NULL abilities or understand how to play with gimmick, and pick the right team.

* Common gimmicks with NULL abilities
** gravity barrier. slows you down.
** damage wall. damages you if touched.
** warp. warps you if touched, hindering movement.
** mines. explodes and inflicts damage if touched.
** magic circle. transform you into (WEAK) chicken state if touched.
** wind. displaces units either inwards or away from wind source. in some stages this wind spreads infectious virus.
** speed down wall. basically stops you (heavy slow down) if touched.
** transferwall transport wall. transports (warps) you if touched
** slowdown floor. Greatly slows down a unit when touched.

* My page has pictures and descriptions for gimmicks and stage effects
* https://monkkeeeyyyydluffy.github.io/monsterstrike/src/pages/gimmicks_and_stage_effects.html

* GW page for always up to date gimmicks. They also include unit status effects, stage items, and more.
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/6170


* My personal notes
* There are more gimmicks than I can count... they continually create new gimmicks as new quests come out.
* A very common theme is...
* You must do "something" in order to deal damage, or else deal nearly 0 damage.
* IE. You must defense down enemies or attack up your allies to do damage.
** IE. touch 3 allies to increase attack gimmick
** IE. use photons to trigger enemy defense down (photons gimmick varies per quest)
* Theres also the, you must do "something" in order to not die from fatal enemy damage.
* Newer Quests can require 3 NULL abilities to counter gimmicks


* Common question: I'm a new player. Why did I randomly die?
** Watch if any attack on your unit occurs... Higher difficulties have elemental attacks that will deal fatal instant death damage if you do not bring entire team with correct element.  (IE. must bring 4 water units to a fire quest)
** May have run into a damage wall, or mine.


* Notes:
* I am using terms loosely and interchangeably.. gimmick, hazard, stage effect, etc...
* the ENG wiki is more strict on the terms.. defines hazards as hazards that can be countered with NULL abilities, such as gravity barriers.
* Gimmicks would be other gimmicks within quest such as using photons, touch allies to increase attack, and etc...

!Quest Difficulties
==================


* all zetsus (chouzetsu, bakuzetsu, gouzetsu)
* all quests
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/21559



* chouzetsus (impossible) - way back in 2014ish,these were the hardest quest in the game.  nowadays its 5-9*/15 difficulty and much easier.  IMO, minimal benefit to farming these
* No dedicated GW page afaik

* bakuzetsu (colossal) - 8-13* difficulty,  can farm these to get EX invades. EX invade mon are strong units to have.
* No dedicated GW page afaik


* gouzetsu (rogue) - 12-15* difficulty. can be useful ML units. can farm 990 gouzetsu points per quest. units here have trancension forms.
** https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/110048
** https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/466310

* reizetsu - 15+* difficulty. some of the hardest content in the game. difficult to max luck due to a win streak system. units here have shin div forms.
** https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/421311
** NO drops from reward chests
** Only 1 to 3 direct drops from boss
** and a win streak system - +2 drops for 2 win streak, +3 drops for 3+ win streak.
** no soul badges, no berries, no lending mon (karimon)

* insidious - 8-15* difficulty, usually closer to gouzetsu level.
* there are many variants of insidous, such as: insidious sai, insidious ketsu, etc...
** insidious ketsu is the battle ticket system (Seele, Chernobog)
* each collab has insidious quest(s)
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/161892


* chouzetsu/bakuzetsu ranked based on difficulty (not updated often?)
* typically a very old quest is much easier
** thus even the oldest gouzetsu may be as easy as a modern chouzetsu
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/22464


* My page on quest difficulties

!Rank/Experience farming
========================

* For those saving 1 stamina quests from normals..
* See my copy pasta


    TLDR get at least the first 3 before doing 1stamina quests:
    1- genius (学びの力) ableberry :Lberry: (+60%) or :BerryEL: (+65%)
    2- exp monspot+ (+75%) or exp monspot (+50%)
    3- activate :bell~1: for 3x exp for 1 hour.
    4- use Seele in team  (+50%)... BUT this mon was only available if you played November 2024-April2025... can add seele friend instead. trick for unlimited friend usage listed below...

    When ready, clear 1staminaquests starting from the top.

    Going more detailed...
    for the 1stamina quests, depending on your setup, should reach somewhere between rank 400-500~, if starting from rank80~ ish.
    Setup details:

    1- get genius (学びの力) ableberry :Lberry: (+60%) or :BerryEL: (+65%).   FYI to new players... grab the M berry :berrys: if it drops, then use :wakumin: to upgrade it to :Lberry:
    2- exp monspot+ (+75%) or exp monspot (+50%) .  type ".monspot" in #bot-playground chat to see how it works.  unless you live in japan, getting exp spot is RNG and you have to try daily.  can also use real money and purchase monpass premium (1980yen  ;  https://monster-strike-enjp.fandom.com/wiki/Monpass  )
    3- activate :bell~1: for 3x exp for 1 hour.  if willing to spend real money, subscribe to monpass premium for 1980 yen and you get kingspot (all monspot powers activated).
    4- use Seele in team  (+50%)... can add a friend with Seele if you dont have your own.  As you use a friend helper, they cannot be used again until certain amount of time passes, or you use friendmin :friendmin: item to refresh friend list.   The trick to avoid using :frienditem: items is to remove all other friends. if you only have one friend in your friendlist, you can use their Seele unlimited number of times.  if your friends seele has genius berry, you dont need to farm your own right now.  (wiki calls it "Zeele"    https://monster-strike-enjp.fandom.com/wiki/Zeele  )


    There are two more ways to get EXP, a ML lucky bonus (+5% at 675ML; new player wont be able to get this anytime soon), and monpass +5% when playing coop (but dont do coop, it slows down your runs)


* For those specifically wanting to rank farm
* Farm normals, the latest set has base 40,000 experience per clear
* With the right setup, it goes up to nearly 545,000 experience per clear, with almost <1 minute clear times.
* Caveats - those trying to reach max rank 2500, will not have enough bells to always get ideal setup.  Will have to use other events, or farm the 2x experience events.
* GW normals guide
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/6978


* There are other exp events, such as collab 50x skill, and a rabbit (keiusa) exp event

* GW recommended quest for 50x collab skill (slime) (limited time only)
* Seems this collab skill comes back every so often.
* https://xn--eckwa2aa3a9c8j8bve9d.gamewith.jp/article/show/485641



* I have an EXP calculator here:
* It's based on playing normals with (40,000 base experience) or the latest set of 1 stamina stages.
* https://monkkeeeyyyydluffy.github.io/monsterstrike/src/pages/tools/exp.html




* My personal notes
** The game always "power creeps" the experience farming for those chasing, ie max rank is 2500 now.
** IE. it is significantly easier and faster to reach rank 1000 today

!State of the game
==================

* Just misc notes from my opinions

* The game isn't linear in any way, it's more about collecting monsters than progression.

* you can choose how to play, whether casual, low difficulty only, high difficulty/high grinding time investment. and each style is viable.
** the easiest event, has the highest orb rewards (tower); so devs do look out for the casual playerbase.

* if you want to have unlimited things to do, theres more things to do in the game than you have time (probably).
** Some of the most extremely time consuming things in this game:
** ML high difficulty EX stages.. amnedia, cortina, archilet
** reach max rank 2500
*** Farm even further for the eventual max rank 3000
** Farm 99+ win streak on reizetsus.
** Farm significant usage count on your favorite mons. (think over 25,000 usage count on a mon)

* or you can be casual
* only login for free stuff
* only single clear for orbs and a single drop.
* skip all higher difficulty content (no insidious or zetsus), only play lower difficulty quests (extreme and lower)



* very common pattern of slowly power creeping a higher difficulty quest
* common for new higher difficulty content to need new gacha units because the game wants you to roll the gacha.
** on first release session, suitable units will be very narrow.
** first release may only have super old units or general pool units as suitable. It will be very hard with these weaker units.
** release a new gacha unit that is "OK" powered for this quest. Definitely stronger than the general pools.  May even be released in the elemental banners (on average, it is a weaker banner, but one or two units stand out)
** After a bit of time (weeks, few months?), release a collab unit that is quite strong for this quest
** Then maybe, after a bit more time, release either another collab, or alpha, or legends/guardians for this quest that is ridiculously strong for this quest
** After year++, release new forms for older units or a general pool unit that is also ridiculously strong for this quest.
** Sometimes the units become so OP, you ignore the gimmicks and bump combo for the win.


* The highest skilled players clear quests on the very session, and max luck very quickly.
** The quests power creep very quickly as of 2025, so skill requirement drops very quickly.

* For the more average skilled players or box-checked players... If you can be patient, wait for power creep, do not have to wait long in order to clear quests more comfortably.

* There are still so many free pulls, being given out.  I almost never roll elemental banners, yet I have some of the best mons from these banners for free. It will take time for free pulls to make a difference (think 1+ year old account)


* From the pattern of their power creeping, they are quite nice to average skilled/box checked players, as long as you can be patient and wait a bit for power creep.
* Also, if the first release session for higher difficulty quests is not hard, no one will roll the gachas, and they cannot make money and the game will EOS.

* I played during NA and a lot in 2019... the game is significantly easier to play now
** can leech games quickly via quick online multiplayer
** so many more AI translation tools, android phones can instantly translate and overlay on the screen
** youtube has auto-translate and dub
** every 24 hours, the set of quests rotate.  No longer does a quest schedule into 6-8am time slot and you must wake up at 6am to play it.
** Way back then there wasn't monst day, bump combos that obliterate stages, so making max lucks for lucky bonus/soul badge is much easier today.
** They even (basically) gave away a ML that can obliterate stages  ( https://monster-strike-enjp.fandom.com/wiki/Troimerai ).  No farming a quest was needed, just invite two new strikers

* There are monthly collabs now, IMO collabs are some of the most fun content in the game.

!Game Mechanics
===============

For notes I have no other place to put...


* hitboxes are NOT circular
** hit allows ireban (irregular bounce) and match shot/hitstops
** Game Devs. confirmed they aren't circles. one of the dev deep dive videos, they're actually jagged

* Buggy behaviour when unit moves too fast... it appears game only evaluates at X number of frames.. so if you say require a "glow bomb" to explode then your attack increases.. if your unit explodes bomb then hits enemy too quicky,  the game did not yet resolve that it needs to increase your units attack.
** I've heard (auto translate) Choko or Arisu(Alicey) say this occurs near healing wall if your unit moves within 1frame and theres a mine or something.  It may calculate healing wall first, then mine damage, so you die.

* Theres a shotroute on g6, b4, where you hit energy container, go through mid boss, exit midboss with energy still being held, then hit slow panel and then hit mid boss WP (now you consume the energy).
** its funky because you may think you will consume energy while going through mid boss, but you dont.

* enemies can have internal hidden WP, where you deal more damage. Despite WP not being revealed.
** Shot route on c10, b1, where kirinji basically attacks mid bosses crotch area... it deals more damage at that spot.

* Bump aiming usually are one of:
** no aim (like scramble laser, energy circle)
** Dunk (along path of your shot)
** Target weakest enemy
** Target closest enemy
** Target wp
** Target all enemy
** Follows your unit around
** Unless specified wp all the targeting ones go after centers of respective targets


* IE. Kuon bump combo aims via
** 3second delay.
** shoot nearest enemy to you.
** lasers on wall go in X position (old version went in W; trident)
** aims for center of boss. if you land near boss.


* frieren, mystery, trident raypod laser thing
** Looks like about a 30deg triangle to nearest enemy
** Pods shoot toward nearest I believe
** And afterwards it shoots at the enemy nearest the unit you shot where you stopped


!Common team comps
==================

* My personal notes on team patterns I see..

* 3 attackers, 1 support
* 4 attackers
* 2 attackers, 2 support
** 2bump 2copy

* attackers can include units with:
** very high stats
** balanced (bias type) -- this is especially strong in quests with elemental advantage UP
** multiple slayer/killer abilities
*** IE. attack turn slayer, weak point slayer, dark (or another element) slayer, etc....
** strikeshots with high multipliers and/or strong follow up attacks
** and more..

* support can be a variety of things such as:
** increase SS rotation (ss time bullets, ss bound charge, ss charge, etc...)
** buff SS (increases allies attack)
** variety of useful bump combos such as...
** speed up
** attack up (or other bump combos such as attack charge, power field, etc...)
** def up
** bump combo up
** bubbly gift
** healing related (healing bound charge, healing bomb throw, etc...)

* 2bump 2copy
** two units with strong bump combo, may be wrong element for the quest, think neo, masamune, pangu
** two units with copy, with right element for the quest, usually with killer abilities.
** NOTE - do not put sidekick berry on the unit with only copy bump combo, it does not increase damage of the copied ability. It will increase the damage of literally copy bump combo, which has a damage of 0, thus doing nothing. You want sidekicks on the unit with the strong bump combo.





* Some units are hybrid of attacker/support, usually this is a strong (broken) unit.
** masamune pierce form has strong healing, strong bump, strong ss.
** suletta (gundam) has strong healing, durability, strong percent SS.



* many more types when diving further
** wanpan (one punch) units
*** often carried through quest by other 3, then one punched boss to skip bars and win (if strong enough, skip all bars and instantly win).
** poison ss... IE. Pandora's stage 2 ss can deal 104% damage in perfect conditions.
** delay ss - delay breaks revival loops, mechanics where enemies heal to full HP, and greatly helps in quests with short OHKO counters
** L (2025 new year mon) the attack UP sharing slave; common to bring her only for her assist skill of sharing attack up; even if she is completely gimmick incompatible for a quest.



* fixed shot teams
** each unit can have very specific task
** can be for speed farming easy quests (normals, temple, easy event quests)
** or for some of the hardest quests in the game, that need to be farmed endlessly, IE. g10 m10...
*** IE. p1 p2 useful for clearing b1;  p3 useful for b5; p4 for wanpan on boss1 (b6)
** the fixed shot teams for high difficulty may be unstable due to precise shots, starting position, precise requirements for speed stat so you always land in precise location, etc..

* Speed farming can include literally weaker and slower units, alongside a unit to wanpan
* IE. speed farming temple solo with Lucy can be
** p1 is unit you want to put berry
** p2,p3 use kuriboh (slow speed so turn ends faster, no gauge so faster to shoot, pierce easier to aim and avoid ireban)
** p4 lucy, trigger her bump combo to wanpan



!Player Goals
=============

* My personal notes
* Player Goals or what do I do next? What do I do in this game

* Farm more ML.
* Clear more quests/content
* Keep up with latest events/collabs

* Farm orbs to roll gachas
* Farm rank
* Farm usage count
* Farm affinity (play coop with ingame friends, filled up a meter daily, eventually earn orb tickets)

* Learn different shots
** pinches
** bounce off wall into a pinch
** Diamond
** figure 8
** "Corner looping shot" (IDK what to call it)
** The different shapes.. N shot, Z shot, W shot, M shot
** Try to accurately follow route trajectory for multiple bounces

* Keep playing more quests to learn different units, gimmicks, shots, team comps.

* ML related
** Lucky bonus caps at 700ML
** Soul badge skills caps at 10,000 power per element
*** Could be worded as 500ML, 100ML per element.
** Lucky mons of the week requires 3/8 every week;  The more ML you have the better.


!Glossary
=========


* My personal notes on misc terms in the game

* Some background...
* The game was released in north america back around 2014 (?), so some terms have official english translation.
* NA server went EOS around 2017 (?), thus newer in game terms have no official translation.
* Thus newer english terms will just be terms from Scott, English Wiki, or discord chat.

* Most other resources will NOT include auto translate terms via browser/youtube, but I will have them here.
** I use Google Chrome browser for auto translate. Terms will differ based on auto translate tool.


* punch/direct hit/puncher
    - when you directly hit an enemy, it can be called punching (so NOT bump combo damage)
* friendship/bump combo/hot friend attack
    - when you directly hit (bump) an ally, it triggers their bump combo. auto translate commonly calls this friendship
* small fry/mobs
    - non boss enemies are called mobs or small fry
* mid boss
    - mid bosses have large health bar at top of screen, but appear before the boss stages

* super ultimate/ultimate/extreme/blast/roaring
    - if you are coming here from auto translate, i have bad news.  Monster strike difficulty names are horrible when they become auto translated and you cannot differentiate them. you have to read them in the japanese form. If you come to discord and ask what is Super Ultimate; none of us will know whether its reizetsu, insidious, lethal, or something else.

* EX/invade
    - some quests only appear when clearing a different quests, granting you a chance to play a "secret" quest.  IIRC the "EX" is for "EX"tra quest

* stall
    - purposely try to not clear a battle, thus stalling. Often for charging up SS, or growing items, or entering next battle on a specific players turn.

* pinch
    - when two enemies have a small gap, and you get shoot inbetween the gap to get "stuck" or pinch between the enemies.

* cancan
    - IIRC japanese speakers may say "cancan" and this is for when you directly attack between a wall and enemy, hitting them many times.  Usually a narrow angle shot so you get more "stuck" and do not bounce out.

* hit stop/mach shot
    - sometimes when you shoot, your unit will be moving then it hits the enemy and abruptly stops, and the direct hit counter increases rapidly.  You can get up to 20-100+ hits in an instant when this happens and inflict substantial damage.  I do not know the secret to this shot, but highly skilled players can intentionally aim for this shot.

* ireban/irregular bounce
    - sometimes when your unit is moving and hits enemy, it will bounce off in a completely "random" direction.  This is because the hitbox is not a circle, but a lot of jagged edges. You are essentially hitting a corner.

* SS/strike shot
    - special attack that must be charged up, and when ready you see an "OK" on your unit portrait. Tap unit and it says "GO", then shoot to use your special attack.

* Bash SS
    - SS that sticks to the first hit enemy. Will not bounce off enemy, it literally sticks to enemey.

* "Something" Don SS: IE. Wall Don SS/Enemy Don SS/Warp Don SS
    - SS that increases in attack according to the "Don" in the name. So a wall don SS grows stronger the number of times you hit the wall, an enemy don SS grows stronger the more enemies you hit, etc...

* Grand command SS
    - SS that shoots all your allies in same direction as current unit.

* Motivate/Lead SS
    - SS that will move your allies when you directly hit them. The direction of the allies movement is dependent on the direction when they were hit.

* SS Follow up
    - Many modern SS have a follow up mechanic, where after unit shoots and stops moving, another follow up special attack occurs.  The follow up can have different targetting mechanics: follow up on boss, follow up on first hit enemy, follow up on nearby enemy, follow up on entire screen.

* Percent SS
    - SS that deals percentage damage.  This can be percentage of maximum HP, or percentage of remaining HP.

* "something"mara.. IE. amumara
    - marathoning (farming) for an EX quest. amumara would be marathoning paranovia, to farm Amnedia EX quest.  If someone says they are doing amumara, they are farming paranovia to try to get Amnedia EX
